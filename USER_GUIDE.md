# User Guide: Managing Tactical Priorities

Welcome to the KSU Strategic Dashboard. This guide explains how you and your contributors can manage the "Taking Flight to 2026" plan.

## 1. Navigating the Dashboard
- **Sidebar**: Select a Strategic Pillar (e.g., "Giant Killer" Mindset) to view its specific objectives and metrics.
- **Pillar Briefing**: Click the "Volume" icon next to any pillar title to hear an AI-generated executive briefing.

## 2. Managing Tactical Priorities (Tasks)

### Option A: Manual UI (Visual)
- **Add Task**: Use the Strategic AI Agent and type/say "Add a task to Pillar 1...".
- **Edit Task**: On any task card, click the **Pencil Icon** (top right). A modal will appear allowing you to update the task name, owner, priority, and status.
- **Delete Task**: Currently handled via the AI Agent ("Delete the task named [X]").

### Option B: AI Voice Agent (Command)
Activate the **Strategic AI Agent** (bottom right) and use natural language:
- *"Change the priority of the season ticket sales task to Critical."*
- *"Assign the broadcast sponsorship model to Rob Aycock."*
- *"Update the status of the Owls Fund gap to '80% Complete'."*

## 3. Cloud Syncing
- The system automatically syncs every 10 seconds.
- Look for the **Cloud Checkmark** in the header to confirm your changes are saved to the cloud.
- If you see a red **"DB MISSING"** warning, contact the administrator to run the SQL migration.
